1) We want a browser to have the ability to communicate with a server through the internet for example:
get data, send data, show videos and visuals etc..

3) 
  a) The client side responsibility will be to let the user see a page that represent the data in a readable way.
     (and if we can it should have nice visuals :) )

  b) In the back-end we should run an engine that waits for http requests.
     the server should return the requested page and be able to identify the current user and the machine he is using to access the page.

4)
  server characteristics:
    be able to recive requests send new data and altered saved data
    able to process mime
    have an internet connection
    identify the user that trying to reach it
    and it will be good if it has great amount of ram and cpu
